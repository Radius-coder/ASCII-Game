# ASCII-Game
This project uses text to create a 2d game. So far I have created a 2d grid that includes a player and an enemy. The player can move around while the enemy chases them.


## To run
First run input.py. This program takes the movement inputs and updates gam.py without the need for the user to press enter after every input.
Secondly run gam.py. This program shows the grid, player and enemy. The enemy position is updated here.

## Features
Move player with WASD.
Enemy moves towards player position.
Player has 3 lives. They lose one life when the enemy is in the same position.
Game ends when player has 0 lives.
